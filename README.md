## 📂 Topics

1. 🧩 **Array & String** – Core problems involving data traversal, manipulation, and optimization.  
2. 🎯 **Two Pointers** – Solve problems efficiently on sorted or paired data using dual indices.  
3. 🔄 **Sliding Window** – Optimize subarray/substring operations by maintaining a dynamic window.  
4. ➕ **Prefix Sum** – Use prefix arrays to quickly compute range sums and differences.  
5. ⚙️ **Hash Map & Set** – Store and lookup values in constant time; handle frequency and uniqueness problems.  
6. 🧱 **Stack** – LIFO structure; used in parsing, recursion simulation, and monotonic problems.  
7. 📬 **Queue** – FIFO structure; key for BFS and scheduling.  
8. 🔗 **Linked List** – Manage dynamic node connections; merge, reverse, and detect cycles.  
9. 🌲 **Binary Tree - DFS** – Depth-first traversal patterns: preorder, inorder, postorder.  
10. 🌳 **Binary Tree - BFS** – Level-order traversal; solve layer-based and shortest path problems.  
11. 🌿 **Binary Search Tree** – Efficiently search, insert, or delete using BST properties.  
12. 🕸️ **Graphs - DFS** – Explore paths, connected components, and cycles using recursion or stack.
